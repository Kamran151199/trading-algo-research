# 5-Minute Video Script: Bitcoin Price Prediction

**(0:00-0:15) Introduction**

*   **(Visual):** Title card with project title, your name, and course information.
*   **Narrator:** "Hello, my name is Komron Valijonov, and this is my project for SS25 - MLSS C: Bitcoin Price Prediction using a Hybrid CNN-LSTM Model with Attention."

**(0:15-0:45) The Challenge of Bitcoin Prediction**

*   **(Visual):** A chart showing the high volatility of Bitcoin's price.
*   **Narrator:** "Bitcoin is known for its extreme price swings, making it incredibly challenging to predict. My goal was to develop a deep learning model that could navigate this complexity and provide accurate price forecasts."

**(0:45-1:30) The Data and Features**

*   **(Visual):** A table summarizing the dataset, showing the different feature categories.
*   **Narrator:** "To do this, I used a comprehensive dataset with 18 different features. This included not just market data like price and volume, but also on-chain metrics and a wide range of technical indicators like RSI and MACD."

**(1:30-2:30) The Model: CNN-LSTM with Attention**

*   **(Visual):** A diagram of the CNN-LSTM with Attention architecture.
*   **Narrator:** "The core of my project is a hybrid deep learning model. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network, or CNN, to extract key features from the data. This is then fed into a Long Short-Term Memory network, or LSTM, which is great at understanding sequences and time-series data. Finally, I added an attention mechanism, which allows the model to intelligently focus on the most important features and time steps when making a prediction."

**(2:30-3:30) The Results: Predictions vs. Reality**

*   **(Visual):** The `demo_predictions.png` image, showing the model's predictions against the actual prices.
*   **Narrator:** "So, how did it do? Here you can see the model's predictions on the test set. While no model is perfect, it does a good job of capturing the overall trend of the Bitcoin price."

**(3:30-4:15) Under the Hood: Attention Mechanism**

*   **(Visual):** The `demo_feature_attention.png` and `demo_temporal_attention.png` images.
*   **Narrator:** "The attention mechanism also gives us a peek inside the model's 'black box'. We can see which features it considers most important - in this case, Bollinger Bands, RSI, and MACD. We can also see how it focuses on different time steps, giving more weight to recent data."

**(4:15-4:45) Conclusion**

*   **(Visual):** A summary slide with the key takeaways.
*   **Narrator:** "In conclusion, the hybrid CNN-LSTM with Attention model is a powerful tool for Bitcoin price prediction. It combines the strengths of different neural network architectures to provide accurate forecasts and valuable insights."

**(4:45-5:00) Outro**

*   **(Visual):** A final slide with your contact information and a link to the project's GitHub repository.
*   **Narrator:** "Thank you for watching. If you'd like to learn more, please check out my project on GitHub."
