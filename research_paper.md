## 1. Introduction

Cryptocurrency markets have emerged as one of the most volatile and complex financial ecosystems, characterized by rapid price movements, 24/7 trading, and significant influence from social media sentiment and regulatory announcements. The challenge of accurately predicting cryptocurrency prices has attracted considerable attention from both academic researchers and financial practitioners, driven by the potential for substantial returns and the need for effective risk management strategies.

Traditional financial forecasting methods, while successful in conventional markets, face significant limitations when applied to cryptocurrency markets due to their unique characteristics: extreme volatility, non-stationary behavior, and the influence of non-traditional factors such as blockchain metrics and social media sentiment. This has led to increased interest in applying advanced machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning models, to cryptocurrency price prediction.

### 1.1 Problem Statement

The main challenges in cryptocurrency price prediction include:

1. **High Volatility**: Cryptocurrency prices exhibit extreme volatility, making traditional statistical models inadequate
2. **Non-stationarity**: Market dynamics change rapidly, requiring adaptive modeling approaches
3. **Multi-modal Data Integration**: Effective prediction requires integration of diverse data sources including price data, blockchain metrics, and sentiment data
4. **Feature Complexity**: Determining which features contribute most to prediction accuracy remains challenging
5. **Temporal Dependencies**: Cryptocurrency markets exhibit complex temporal patterns that simple models cannot capture

### 1.2 Research Objectives

This research aims to address these challenges through the following objectives:

1. Develop a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture that effectively captures both local patterns and temporal dependencies in cryptocurrency price data
2. Integrate attention mechanisms to improve model focus on relevant features and time steps
3. Evaluate the effectiveness of multi-modal data integration including market data, on-chain metrics, and technical indicators
4. Provide explainable AI insights into model decision-making processes
5. Demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline approaches

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Cryptocurrency Price Prediction

Recent advances in cryptocurrency price prediction have focused on applying deep learning techniques to capture the complex, non-linear relationships in financial time series data. Cohen & Aiche (2025) developed an AI-driven strategy for Bitcoin price prediction achieving a 1640.32% return by leveraging ensemble neural networks with social media sentiment data. Their work demonstrated the importance of incorporating alternative data sources beyond traditional financial metrics.

Rodrigues & Machado (2025) conducted a comparative study of machine learning models for high-frequency cryptocurrency forecasting, finding that GRU neural networks achieved superior predictive accuracy with a MAPE of 0.09% for 60-minute ahead predictions. This research highlighted the effectiveness of recurrent neural networks for capturing temporal dependencies in cryptocurrency data.

### 2.2 Hybrid CNN-LSTM Architectures

The combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks has shown promising results in time series forecasting. CNNs excel at extracting local patterns and features from sequential data, while LSTMs are designed to capture long-term temporal dependencies. Kumar & Ji (2025) proposed CryptoPulse, a dual prediction mechanism that incorporates macroeconomic fluctuations and technical indicators, demonstrating the effectiveness of hybrid architectures.

### 2.3 Attention Mechanisms in Financial Forecasting

Attention mechanisms have revolutionized sequence modeling by allowing models to focus on the most relevant parts of the input data. Kehinde et al. (2025) introduced the Helformer model, integrating Holt-Winters exponential smoothing with Transformer-based attention mechanisms for cryptocurrency time series decomposition. Their work showed that attention mechanisms can significantly improve prediction accuracy by identifying critical time steps and features.

### 2.4 Gap Analysis

While existing research has made significant contributions to cryptocurrency price prediction, several gaps remain:

1. **Limited Integration**: Most studies focus on single data modalities rather than comprehensive multi-modal integration
2. **Explainability**: Few studies provide insights into model decision-making processes
3. **Feature Importance**: Limited analysis of which features contribute most to prediction accuracy
4. **Attention Visualization**: Insufficient exploration of attention mechanisms for understanding model behavior

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Dataset Description

Our research utilizes a comprehensive dataset spanning from August 2024 to June 2025, containing 316 daily observations of Bitcoin price data. The dataset integrates multiple data sources:

#### 3.1.1 Market Data
- **Price Data**: Open, High, Low, Close (OHLC) prices and trading volume
- **Source**: Alpha Vantage API
- **Frequency**: Daily observations

#### 3.1.2 On-chain Metrics
- **Active Addresses Count** (`adractcnt`): Number of unique addresses active in transactions
- **Transaction Count** (`txcnt`): Total number of transactions per day
- **Fee Total Native Value** (`feetotntv`): Total transaction fees in native currency

#### 3.1.3 Technical Indicators
We computed 11 technical indicators using the `ta` library:

### 3.2 Data Preprocessing

#### 3.2.1 Normalization
All features were normalized using MinMaxScaler to ensure consistent scales across different data types:

```python
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
df_scaled[feature_cols] = scaler.fit_transform(df[feature_cols])
```

#### 3.2.2 Sequence Creation
Time series sequences were created using a sliding window approach with a window size of 30 days:

```python
def create_sequences(data, window_size=30):
    X, y = [], []
    for i in range(len(data) - window_size):
        X.append(data[feature_cols].iloc[i:i + window_size].values)
        y.append(data[target_col].iloc[i + window_size])
    return np.array(X), np.array(y)
```

#### 3.2.3 Data Splitting
The dataset was split into training (70%), validation (15%), and testing (15%) sets, maintaining temporal order to prevent data leakage.

### 3.3 Model Architecture

We developed two main architectures: a baseline CNN-LSTM model and an enhanced CNN-LSTM with attention mechanisms.

#### 3.3.1 Baseline CNN-LSTM Model

The baseline model consists of:

1. **CNN Layer**: 1D convolution with 64 filters and kernel size 3
2. **Batch Normalization**: For training stability
3. **LSTM Layer**: 128 hidden units for temporal modeling
4. **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers for final prediction

```python
class CNNLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_features, cnn_filters=64, lstm_units=128):
        super(CNNLSTM, self).__init__()
        self.cnn = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv1d(in_channels=num_features, out_channels=cnn_filters, 
                     kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.BatchNorm1d(cnn_filters),
        )
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size=cnn_filters, hidden_size=lstm_units, 
                           batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(lstm_units, 64), 
            nn.ReLU(), 
            nn.Linear(64, 1)
        )
```

#### 3.3.2 CNN-LSTM with Attention

The enhanced model incorporates two types of attention mechanisms:

##### Feature Attention
Allows the model to weight different input features based on their relevance:

```python
class FeatureAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_features):
        super(FeatureAttention, self).__init__()
        self.feature_attention = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(num_features, num_features // 2),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(num_features // 2, num_features),
            nn.Sigmoid()
        )
```

##### Temporal Attention
Focuses on the most important time steps in the sequence:

```python
class TemporalAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size, num_heads=4):
        super(TemporalAttention, self).__init__()
        self.query = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size, bias=False)
        self.key = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size, bias=False)
        self.value = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size, bias=False)
```
